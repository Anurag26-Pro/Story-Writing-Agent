**- What is Agent AI?**
Agent AI refers to artificial intelligence systems designed to perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously, often mimicking human-like decision-making and problem-solving abilities. These systems are typically driven by advanced algorithms and models, enabling them to interact with their environment, learn from experiences, and make informed decisions.

**- Different type of Agent AI**
1. Reactive Agents: These agents operate based on a set of predefined rules and do not have memory of past experiences. They respond to stimuli in a specific manner.
2. Deliberative Agents: These agents use a form of internal representation and planning to make decisions. They consider various potential actions and their consequences before acting.
3. Learning Agents: These agents can improve their performance over time by learning from past experiences. They often employ machine learning techniques to adapt to new situations.
4. Interactive Agents: These agents can interact with users or other systems, often utilizing natural language processing and other communication methods.

**- What is Multi Agent?**
Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) involve the interaction of multiple autonomous agents working together to achieve a common goal or to solve complex problems. These systems are designed to leverage the strengths and capabilities of individual agents, enabling them to collaborate, compete, or negotiate with each other to accomplish tasks more effectively than a single agent could.

1. Story Writer Agent: Agent who writes the story.
2. Story Reviewer Agent: Agent who review the story written by story writer Agent.

Step 1. User Provide the title of the Story.
Step 2. Story Writer Agent write the story based on user input. Once story is completed story reviwer review the story.
Step 3. Story Reviewer review the story written by Story writter and provided the feedback. 
Step 4. Once story review the story will share the feedback with story writer. Once Story review "Approve" the story written by Story writer the communication stoped.
